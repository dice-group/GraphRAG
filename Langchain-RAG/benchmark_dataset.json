If you are looking for a supervisor for a thesis on LLM, it might be worth checking if any of the researchers, particularly those with a focus on machine learning or natural language processing, have experience or interest in this area. Dr. rer. nat. Arnab Sharma, for instance, has research interests that include robustness in graph machine learning, explainable machine learning, and security in graph machine learning, which might be related to LLMs. However, without specific information, it's not possible to definitively state who has supervised a thesis on LLM."
